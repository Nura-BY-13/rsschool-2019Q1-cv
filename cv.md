At the moment I am a lecturer in Brest State Technical University, therefore, at least, it is interesting to see how the training webinars are conducted. I want to evaluate my capabilities, expand the boundaries, open to new information. The mood is raised from the ability to place the task in a capacious and clear algorithm. *I believe that learning what is interesting should be a daily ritual*.
 
###Skills:
markup language HTML and a formal language for describing the appearance of a CSS document to complete homework for this course.
 
###Code examples: 
due to lack of experience, code examples only include homework assignments for this course.

###Experience: 
there is no global experience, but I will try to build it. During studies at the master's and postgraduate programs I created macros in *MSExcel* to calculate the labor intensity of manufacturing precast concrete structures and wrote programs in *MathCAD* for statistical evaluation of basic wind load parameters using the pseudo-noise quantization method.
 
###Education: 
graduated from Brest State Technical University. Civil Engineer. Master of Technical Sciences. Candidate of Technical Sciences. Assistant professor.

###English level: 
in the mood I can start a conversation with students - foreign citizens in English. I do not always understand. I do not always understand them. But I am almost sure that the whole thing is in the mood;-) Level **A2 ... B1**. Communication experience is limited to a few phrases in tourist trips.
