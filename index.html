        therefore, at least, it is interesting to see how the training webinars are conducted. I want to evaluate my
        capabilities, expand the boundaries, open to new information. The mood is raised from the ability to place the
        task in a capacious and clear algorithm. I believe that learning what is interesting should be a daily
        ritual</h3>
