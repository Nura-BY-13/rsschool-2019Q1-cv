    <h3 class="begin"> At the moment I am a <span class="bold"> teacher in Brest State Technical University </span>
        therefore, at least, it is interesting to see how the training webinars are conducted. I want to evaluate my
        capabilities, expand the boundaries, open to new information. The mood is raised from the ability to place the
        task in a capacious and clear algorithm. <span class="bold">I believe that learning what is interesting
        should be a daily ritual</span></h3>
    <h3>Skills:</h3>
    <p>markup language HTML and a formal language for describing the appearance of a CSS document to complete homework
        for this course</p>

    <p>due to lack of experience, code examples only include homework assignments for this course</p>
    <h3>Experience:</h3>
    <p>there is no global experience, but I will try to build it. During studies at the master's and postgraduate
        programs I created macros in MSExcel to calculate the labor intensity of manufacturing precast concrete
        structures and wrote programs in MathCAD for statistical evaluation of basic wind load parameters using the
        pseudo-noise quantization method</p>
    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>graduated from Brest State Technical University. Civil Engineer. Master of Technical Sciences. Candidate of
        Technical Sciences. Assistant professor</p>
    <h3>English level:</h3>
    <p>in the mood I can start a conversation with students - foreign citizens in English. I do not always understand. I
        do not always understand them. But I am almost sure that the whole thing is in the mood;-) Level <span
            class="bold"> A2 ... B1 </span>. Communication experience is limited to a few phrases in tourist trips</p>
